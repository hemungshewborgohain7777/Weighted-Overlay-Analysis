# Weighted-Overlay-Analysis
I have done Weighted Overlay Analysis for Flood Susceptibility in Kaziranga National Park, Assam India.
Flood Suceptibility is the final output/map which i have created from the inputs which have been projected to WGS 1948 UTM46N and reclassified to 5 classes.

I applied the Weighted Overlay Method integrating multiple geospatial parameters to assess flood-prone zones accurately.

Input Parameters:
🗺️ Digital Elevation Model (DEM)
⛰️ Slope
🌊 Flow Accumulation
🏞️ Euclidean Distance from River
🌾 Land Use/Land Cover (LULC)
🌧️ Annual Rainfall
🧱 Soil Type

Satellite - Landsat 5&8 
Rainfall Data - CHIRPS / IMD Pune
Soil Data - SWAR
Streams - DIVA GIS
Application - ArcMap 10.8 & GEE

*5 Km Buffer Zone created for better analysis.

Each factor was reclassified and assigned weights based on its relative influence on flooding, allowing a composite flood susceptibility index to be derived. The final map categorizes the area into zones ranging from Very Low to Very High Susceptibility, supporting better planning, conservation, and disaster preparedness in this UNESCO World Heritage Site.
